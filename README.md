## 🎯 What is Stellar Tipz?

**Stellar Tipz** is a next-generation Web3 tipping platform that revolutionizes how creators receive support from their audience. Built on Stellar's high-performance blockchain with Soroban smart contracts, Tipz combines lightning-fast transactions, minimal fees, and a unique credit score system to create the most creator-friendly tipping experience in the industry.

### 🌟 The Problem We're Solving

- **Complex processes** requiring multiple tools and platforms

### ✨ Our Solution

Tipz delivers:
- ⚡ **Instant settlements** in 3-5 seconds (not weeks)
- 💰 **Only 2% withdrawal fee** (95% savings vs traditional platforms)
- 🌍 **Global by default** - no geographic restrictions
- 🏆 **Transparent credit scores** based on X (Twitter) metrics
- 🎨 **Beautiful brutalist UI** - fast, accessible, memorable
- � **Simple URLs** - `tipz.app/@username` for easy sharing
- 🔒 **Fully on-chain** - complete transparency and security

Maximum: 1000 points
```
