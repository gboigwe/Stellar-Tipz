# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory captures the significant architectural decisions made on Stellar
Tipz — the *context*, the *options considered*, and the *rationale* — so future
contributors understand **why** the system looks the way it does, not just how.

We follow a lightweight [Michael Nygard](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
style. Each record is immutable once `Accepted`; to change a decision, add a new
ADR that `Supersedes` the old one and mark the old one `Superseded`.

## Index

| ADR | Title | Status |

| [002](./ADR-002-design-system.md) | Brutalist design system | Accepted |
| [003](./ADR-003-credit-score-algorithm.md) | Credit score algorithm design | Accepted |

## Adding a new ADR

1. Copy [`template.md`](./template.md) to `ADR-NNN-short-title.md` (next number).
2. Fill in the sections; keep it focused on a single decision.
3. Add a row to the index above.
4. Open a PR — the decision is reviewed like code.
